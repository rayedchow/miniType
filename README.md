# miniType

A Minimalist Web-Server Typing Application. 

## Front-end

- The `views/` folder contains the vanilla HTML webpage content
- The `public/` folder contains the middle-end code (webpage js & css)

## Back-end

- The main back-end node-js file is `server.js`, which is where all routing/back-end data is stored
